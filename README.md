# Genetic-Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of 
natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.  

Genetic Algorithm can be explained by the following steps:

Here in this repository, I have demonstrated an end-to-end code of a Genetic Algorithm used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  


TSP can be described as follows:  
*Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?*
