# Genetic-Algorithm
A [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural 
evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce 
offspring of the next generation.  

Genetic Algorithm can be explained by the following steps:

Here in this repository, I have demonstrated an end-to-end code of each and every step of Genetic Algorithm which is used to solve the Traveling 
Salesman Problem (TSP). In the 'geneticAlgorithm.ipynb', I have critically explained all the steps coded in Python in a similar manner as flow 
diagram above.

TSP can be described as follows:  
*Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the 
origin city?*
